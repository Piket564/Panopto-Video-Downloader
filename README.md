# Panopto Video Downloader
A simple extension for Google Chrome that allows you to download videos from Panopto for later viewing.

# N.B.:
the extension works if your university has not made any changes to the Panopto player. If your university uses different players from the default one in Panopto (it's something that could be checked in the code) this extsension won't works. Unfortunately I don't have access to all players from all universities in order to make an universal version :(

I'm not a professional programmer, I just tried to adapt something to make it useful :)
So, if you know someone who can solve these problems, invite them to review the code :)

# How to install:
Add it to Chrome or EDGE (based on Chromium) from Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/panopto-video-downloader/fldiimnkhimjonkiklkchogonpidmmca?hl=it

Or download the code and install it in your browser following these instructions: https://github.com/ManoloZocco/Panopto-Video-Downloader/wiki/How-to-install

# How to use:
Navigate to the Panopto video itself you want to download, Click on the extension icon (it's green and located at the top right of your browser) and choose where you want the video to be saved.

NOTE:
Feel free to comment if you have problems using it, or if it stops working.
Feel free to propose changes and improvements: as mentioned above, I am not a professional programmer :)
You can propose changes to me or use the code to create an improved version.
